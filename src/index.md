EMAT10006: Further Programming - C
==================================

This site is where we will store the notes for the first part of EMAT10006 (C
programming). The links below take you to the notes sections which are the
main material you should read. Below there are also links to the lecture
slides...

IMPORTANT
---------

Due to the way the University computers are not properly configured the
`python` executable is not on the `$PATH` environment variable. To add it to
`PATH` from the MinGW shell type:
```
  export PATH=$PATH:"/c/Program Files/Anaconda3"
```
