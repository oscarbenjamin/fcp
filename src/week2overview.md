Week 2 overview
===============

This is the start of the notes for week 2. At this point I'm assuming that you
know how to compile and run a simple C program and that you understand how
to use the terminal to a basic level. We now have a few more things to cover
both in terms of how to compile and manage your code and also how to write
more useful C programs.

The notes from here will cover more about using the shell and how to compile
your code with `make` and `Makefile`s. Then we will move onto the basics of how
to do conditionals and looping in C and how to structure programs using
functions. Finally we will have an extended example of putting these pieces
together to make a simple program for calculating the roots of a quadratic
polynomial and then some exercises.

It is important when working through this material to actually try things out
and not simply skim over reading everything. The only way to really learn this
stuff is by doing it yourself. With that in mind please test your
understanding by trying to follow through with the commands yourself. If you
can't get something to work don't just move on and forget about it: ask for
help. Everything here is core material that you will need to understand.
