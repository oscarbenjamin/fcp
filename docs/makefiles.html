<h1 id="make-files">Make files</h1>
<h2 id="why-make-files">Why make files?</h2>
<p>You’ll probably find that you’re repeatedly typing out long commands such as <code>gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuff.c -o stuff.exe</code>. In the last section we looked at ways to speed this up by reusing previously typed commands but this technique only gets us so far. What if there’s a very large number of commands to type in order to compile our program? The Python interpreter is a C program and compiling it requires compiling some 500 or so .c files. We don’t want to have to type out the commands for each of those!</p>
<p>The standard solution to this is to use make files. There are several advantages to using make files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saves typing out the commands</li>
<li>Don’t need to remember the commands</li>
<li>Don’t need to ever learn the commands (e.g. when compiling someone else’s code).</li>
<li>Can selectively re-run commands which is more efficient for compiling large projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>A standard convention for distributing the code of C programs is that to compile a C program you first download the source code. Let’s say that the source code is in a file called <code>coolproject-3.1.zip</code>. You expect to unzip that file and find a folder called <code>coolproject-3.1</code> which you will <code>cd</code> into. Now in that folder you will run two commands to build the project</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure
$ make</code></pre>
<p>The <code>./configure</code> command runs a script that is provided with the code. This script will check properties of your system: what compilers you have, what libraries are installed etc. You only need to run this script once after downloading the code. Usually this script will accept arguments that can affect how the code will be compiled for example <code>./configure --debug</code> might build the program with debug settings enabled.</p>
<p>The second command <code>make</code> is what actually compiles the code. This command expects there to be a file called <code>Makefile</code> in the current working directory. It will read that file and then know how to compile everything. This is the command that we run each time we want to re-compile e.g. if we’ve changed the C code.</p>
<p>As an example of something that we would compile using a <code>Makefile</code> I will show how to compile the Python interpreter. Note that this will not work in MinGW and that it takes some time to compile Python…</p>
<p>Download and extract:</p>
<pre><code>$ wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz
$ tar -xzf Python-3.5.1.tgz</code></pre>
<p>Go into the directory and compile:</p>
<p>`<code>$ cd Python-3.5.1/ $ ./configure $ make</code></p>
<p>Run:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./python
Python 3.5.1 (default, Jan 31 2016, 23:11:01)
[GCC 4.9.2] on linux
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So that’s the idea behind make files but how do we actually use them?</p>
<h2 id="simple-make-file">Simple make file</h2>
<p>Create a small C program called e.g. <code>stuffmain.c</code>. This program will compile to produce an executable called <code>stuff.exe</code>. The command to compile is <code>gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuff.c -o stuff.exe</code>. So how do we make a make file for that.</p>
<p>Create a file called <code>Makefile</code>. Note that this filename must be exactly right: is has a capital “M” but is otherwise lower-case. The file does not have a file extension i.e. it is not called <code>Makefile.c</code> or <code>Makefile.txt</code>. You may find that your code editor or your OS makes it difficult to create a file without a file extension so one way is to create it as <code>Makefile.txt</code> and then to rename it in the terminal with the <code>mv</code> (“move”) command:</p>
<pre><code>$ mv Makefile.txt Makefile</code></pre>
<p>So what goes in the make file? A make file contains <em>rules</em> and to begin with we might have only one rule like so:</p>
<pre><code>stuff.exe: stuffmain.c
    gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe</code></pre>
<p>A rule has three components: the <em>target</em> (<code>stuff.exe</code>), the <em>dependencies</em> of the target (<code>stuffmain.c</code>) and the command to run (<code>gcc ...</code>). The meaning of this is that this <code>Makefile</code> defines a target called <code>stuff.exe</code> which is generated from <code>stuffmain.c</code>. The command to generate <code>stuff.exe</code> from <code>stuffmain.c</code> is <code>gcc ...</code>.</p>
<p>With this file saved in the same folder as “stuff.c” we can now invoke <code>make</code> as</p>
<pre><code>$ make stuff.exe
gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe</code></pre>
<p>So now that the make file remembers the command that we need to type we just have to tell it that we want to remake <code>stuff.exe</code> and it will run that command for us. Now see what happens if we ask it to make <code>stuff.exe</code> again:</p>
<pre><code>$ make stuff.exe
make: &#39;stuff.exe&#39; is up to date.</code></pre>
<p>Somehow <code>make</code> knows that it doesn’t need to recompile the code. What happens here is that <code>make</code> looks at <code>stuff.exe</code> and its dependencies (i.e. <code>stuffmain.c</code>) and checks the time that each file was last modified. If <code>stuff.exe</code> is newer than <code>stuffmain.c</code> then there is no need to recompile because <code>stuff.exe</code> is “up to date”. Sometimes we want to force recompiling just to be sure that everything is properly compiled we can do this with <code>make -B</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make -B stuff.exe
gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe</code></pre>
<p>You can see the last modified time of files in a folder by running <code>ls</code> with the <code>-l</code> flag (although I seem to remember that it doesn’t work very well in MinGW…).</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l
total 20
-rw-rw-r-- 1 oscar oscar   68 Feb  3 22:50 Makefile
-rwxrwxr-x 1 oscar oscar 8560 Feb  3 22:55 stuff.exe
-rw-rw-r-- 1 oscar oscar   90 Feb  3 22:50 stuffmain.c</code></pre>
<h2 id="missing-separator-or-nothing-to-be-done">Missing separator or Nothing to be done</h2>
<p>One thing to note here about a make file is that the command is indented. It must be indented with a proper tab character: you cannot use e.g. 4 spaces. If (as is common for Python programmers) you have your editor configured to insert tabs instead of spaces then you may need to disable that setting or copy-paste a tab character from somewhere else to get this to work. My own editor (<code>vim</code>) is clever enough to know that proper tabs are always needed in make files even if I prefer spaces in Python files but that’s not true of all editors.</p>
<p>If you use spaces instead of tabs in your Makefile then you will see one of the following helpful error messages:</p>
<pre><code>$ make stuff.exe
Makefile:2: *** missing separator. Stop.</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps on newer versions you will see something like:</p>
<pre><code>$ make stuff.exe
make: nothing to be done for `stuff.exe&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>At least in the first case <code>make</code> has told us the line (2) in the Makefile on which the error occurs. A good way to tell the difference between tab characters and spaces is to print the file to the terminal with <code>cat -A</code> (or <code>cat -e</code> on OSX). The <code>-A</code> flag to <code>cat</code> makes non-displaying ASCII characters distinguishable:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat -A Makefile
stuff.exe: stuff.c$
    gcc stuff.c -o stuff.exe$</code></pre>
<p>Note that line-ending characters are now shown as <code>$</code> so that we can actually see them. A proper tab character would show up as <code>^I</code> so we can fix the file by deleting those spaces and inserting tabs. It now looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat -A Makefile
stuff.exe: stuff.c$
^Igcc stuff.c -o stuff.exe$</code></pre>
<p>At this point running <code>make stuff.exe</code> should work.</p>
<h2 id="the-all-target">The <code>all</code> target</h2>
<p>Now first I said above that the expected command to compile some code is just <code>make</code> rather than <code>make stuff.exe</code> so how do we make that happen? By default when you simply type <code>make</code> this will try to build the special target which is called <code>all</code>. We can add a rule for that to our Makefile:</p>
<pre><code>all: stuff.exe

stuff.exe: stuffmain.c
  gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe</code></pre>
<p>With this in place we can now run <code>make</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ make
make: Nothing to be done for &#39;all&#39;.</code></pre>
<p>Since everything’s up to date this doesn’t need to recompile.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-programs">Multiple programs</h2>
<p>We might have a whole folder full of .c files each of which should compile to a different .exe file. We can make a Makefile that will compile all of them e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>all: stuff.exe foo.exe bar.exe

stuff.exe: stuffmain.c
  gcc -std=c99 -Wall stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe

foo.exe: foomain.c
  gcc -std=c99 -Wall foomain.c -o foo.exe

bar.exe: barmain.c
  gcc -std=c99 -Wall barmain.c -o bar.exe</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably guess this Makefile will compile <code>stuff.exe</code> as well as <code>foo.exe</code> and <code>bar.exe</code>. We can use it as <code>make foo.exe</code> to make just one of the programs or we just type <code>make</code> then it will re-compile all three (assuming that they are not up to date). We can use a single <code>Makefile</code> to compile as many programs as we like.</p>
<p>The Makefile above is a little repetitive so let’s try to improve it a bit. Firstly we’re passing the same arguments to <code>gcc</code> all the time. We should probably split that out into a variable. Conventionally this variable is called <code>CFLAGS</code>. We can do that like so:</p>
<pre><code>CFLAGS = -std=c99 -Wall

all: stuff.exe foo.exe bar.exe

stuff.exe: stuffmain.c
  gcc $(CFLAGS) stuffmain.c -o stuff.exe

foo.exe: foomain.c
  gcc $(CFLAGS) foomain.c -o foo.exe

bar.exe: barmain.c
  gcc $(CFLAGS) barmain.c -o bar.exe</code></pre>
<p>It’s still quite repetitive though. Every rule (except <code>all</code>) is of the form</p>
<pre><code>&lt;X&gt;.exe: &lt;X&gt;main.c
    gcc $(CFLAGS) &lt;X&gt;main.c -o X.exe</code></pre>
<p>We can have all of the rules generated by using a pattern-matched rule. To do this we use the wildcard <code>%</code> character:</p>
<pre><code>CFLAGS = -std=c99 -Wall

all: stuff.exe foo.exe bar.exe

%.exe: %main.c
  gcc $(CFLAGS) $&lt; -o $@</code></pre>
<p>Now when we run <code>make</code> it knows it needs to build <code>stuff.exe</code> and that it has a pattern-rule for <code>%.exe</code> with <code>%</code> the wildcard. <code>stuff.exe</code> matches this if <code>%</code> is replaced with <code>stuff</code>. Replacing % in the dependency as well we see that it depends on <code>stuffmain.c</code>. So we’ve found a rule that matches <code>stuff.exe</code> and <code>stuffmain.c</code>: <code>make</code> will check the dates of the files to decide whether or not to recompile. If it does need to recompile it will execute the command which also uses special variables. In the command <code>$&lt;</code> refers to the name of the source file (<code>stuffmain.c</code>) and <code>$@</code> refers to the name of the target (<code>stuff.exe</code>).</p>
<p>The advantage of this pattern-matching is obvious: we can re-use one rule for many similar files. Now if you want to add another .exe file to this Makefile you just have to add it to the list of dependencies of the <code>all</code> target.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This is just a brief explanation of how to use Makefiles for simple C programs. <code>make</code> can do a lot more than this but it’s not really needed right now. One thing I will say though is that you can use <code>make</code> for many more things than just C programs. For example these notes are compiled with <code>make</code>: I write them in markdown .md files which are compiled to html using pandoc and I have a Makefile to control that. You can also use <code>make</code> to compile a <code>LaTeX</code> document or to control running simulations and many more things.</p>
